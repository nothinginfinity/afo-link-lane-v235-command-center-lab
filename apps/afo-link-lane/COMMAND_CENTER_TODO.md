# Command Center Lab TODO

## First UI pass

- Add slide-up visor shell.
- Add control deck foundation.
- Keep the existing v2.3.0 focus-mode path intact until each interaction is proven.
- Prefer mock/control-state data before connecting live data.

## Validation pass

- Run `npm install` from `apps/afo-link-lane/`.
- Run `npm run check`.
- Validate embedded browser script extraction/parsing.
- Test mobile gestures and viewport resizing.

## Deployment pass

- Add a lab-only deploy workflow only after the first validated UI pass.
- Deploy to `afo-link-lane-v235-lab` only.
- Confirm production `afo-link-lane` remains unchanged.
